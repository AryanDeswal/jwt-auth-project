# JWT Auth Project

Welcome to the JWT Auth Project! This project is a website designed for user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 

## Introduction

JWT Auth Project provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users accessing your website or application. By implementing JWT authentication, you can ensure that only authorized users are granted access to specific resources or functionalities within your system.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **Secure**: Implements industry-standard security practices to protect user credentials and sensitive data.
- **Scalable**: Designed to scale with the growth of your user base.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple integration with existing web applications.

## Installation

To get started with the JWT Auth Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AryanDeswal/jwt-auth-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd jwt-auth-project`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define environment variables such as `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL`.
5. Start the server: `npm start`

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can access the website and utilize the JWT authentication system. Here's a basic overview of how to use it:

1. **User Registration**: Users can register by providing necessary details such as username, email, and password.
2. **User Login**: Authenticated users can log in using their credentials.
3. **Access Control**: Certain routes or functionalities may require authentication. Ensure that JWT tokens are included in the request headers for accessing protected resources.
4. **Token Management**: Tokens have expiration times. Users may need to refresh their tokens periodically to maintain access.

## Configuration

The JWT Auth Project can be configured according to your specific requirements. Here are some aspects you might want to configure:

- **Token Expiration**: Adjust the expiration time of JWT tokens based on your application's security needs.
- **Token Payload**: Customize the information contained within JWT tokens to include additional user data or metadata.
- **Token Signing Algorithm**: Choose the appropriate algorithm for signing JWT tokens based on security considerations and compatibility requirements.
